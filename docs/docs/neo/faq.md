## How does Microsoft 365 Copilot work for organizations with multiple regions?

All graph data is stored in the **Primary Provisioned Geography** location. This applies even if an organization has satellite regions, as explained here [Plan for Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo - Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-for-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide) but the graph index is only in the primary region (in order to provide a unified search experience across all the tenants).
