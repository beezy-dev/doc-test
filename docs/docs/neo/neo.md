# Structure Your Unstructured Data

## Introduction

The ***NetApp Neo Connector: Structure Your Unstructure Data*** is a containerized solution that transfroms unstructure data from any storage platforms to consumable structured data by agents, MCP servers, and solutions like Microsoft M365 Copilot without the need to migrate or rearchitect your existing data architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NetApp Neo Connector is currently in **Private Preview**. This means that the connector is not yet in a General Availability release and may have some limitations.  
> The connector requires a license to activate. You can request access to the connector by joining the Early Access Program (EAP). Please book a meeting with the following link to join the EAP: [Book a meeting with NetApp](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/d636d7a02ad8477c9af9a0cbb029af4d@netapp.com/meetingtype/nm-mXkp-TUO1CdzOmFfIBw2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=mlink).

## Features

- **OCR and Optimized Extraction** - the connector automatically extracts accurate text from complex documents, making it easier to search and find relevant information in your files (the only connector in the market to provide this feature)
- **GPU Support** - the connector can leverage GPU acceleration for 2-5x faster data extraction and conversion, improving performance and reducing processing time (this is a world-first for a Copilot connector)
- **Containerized Deployment** - typical deployment time is less than 3 minutes
- **Multiple Source Support** - supports SMB File Shares (v3.1.1 through v2.0) including:
  - Azure NetApp Files (ANF)
  - AWS FSxN
  - Google Cloud Volumes NetApp (GCVN)
  - Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)
  - Any ONTAP-based system (FAS, AFF, Select, etc.)
  - Any SMB file share (non-NetApp) that supports SMB v3.1.1 through v2.0
- **No Data Migration Required** - connect your existing NetApp storage to M365 Copilot
- **Item level permissioning** - the connector will automatically extract and convert files from the source file share and transfer them to Microsoft Graph, preserving item-level permissions
- **API Interface** - RESTful API for easy integration and management of the connector, replacing the need for M365 Search and Intelligence UI
- **Enhanced filtering** - filter data based on file type, size, and date
- **Parallelization** - multiple threads for faster data extraction, conversion and transfer
- **Large Document Chunking** - split large documents into smaller chunks for unlimited file ingestion into Microsoft Graph (MS Graph has a 3.8MB Content-Length limit, this feature allows for larger files to be ingested)
- **Offline Licensing** - no need to connect to the internet for licensing
